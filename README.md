> 1. the loose change found in the nooks and crannies of your couch
> 2. a helpful set of scripts and utilities for working with CouchDB and CouchApps

## Why use Couch Change?
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) is incredibly useful, but it lacks certain "bulk" commands that are helpful during development. This project aims to fill some of those gaps by allowing you to: 

- Install and remove CouchDB easily on Linux
- Create and delete whole lists of users _at once with one command_
- Clean CouchDB by removing its default test databases _at once with one command_ (or any other databases matching your desired prefix or suffix)
